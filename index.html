            <h2>2. Encryption and Data Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Encryption PIN:</strong> When you connect your account to Cryptkey, you will set a unique encryption PIN. This PIN serves as the basis for your encryption lock, which secures all your data. This PIN is stored only on your device and is not shared with or accessible by anyone, including Cryptkey.</li>
                <li><strong>PIN Verification Process:</strong> To verify that your PIN is correct, Cryptkey uses dummy data that is attached within the app. This verification method ensures that your actual data remains secure and private without sharing or storing the PIN elsewhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Cryptkey’s encryption key is stored solely on your device. This ensures that your encryption PIN is never exposed or accessible to any third party.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cryptkey securely stores all your data locally on your device using the Hive database. Hive is a highly secure and fast storage solution, ensuring that your data is safe and accessible only to you.</li>
                <li><strong>Offline Use Option:</strong> You may choose to use Cryptkey without signing in. In this case, all data is stored locally on your device, with no cloud backup. If you delete the app or reset your device, your data will be permanently lost.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>4. Data Loss Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption PIN:</strong> Your encryption PIN is critical for data access. If you forget your encryption PIN, it cannot be recovered. Cryptkey’s privacy policy ensures that no backup of the PIN is stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Reset Warning:</strong> If you choose not to sign in and reset your device, your data will be permanently lost. Before resetting your device, please make sure to export your data to avoid losing access.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>5. Data Export and Deletion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exporting Data:</strong> Cryptkey provides an export feature, enabling you to save a backup of your data outside the app. We recommend exporting your data before any device reset or if you choose to uninstall the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Deleting Data:</strong> You may delete all your data at any time by navigating to the settings tab and selecting “Delete.” This will remove all stored data from your device permanently.</li>
